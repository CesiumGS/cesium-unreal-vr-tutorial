## 1. Create and tag a release üè∑Ô∏è

- Once the tutorial PR has been merged, create a new tag and release for the tutorial. Tags should be named with a 'v' before the number with minor versions increasing with each tutorial release. For example:

```
git tag -a v1.11 -m "Cesium for Unreal VR Tutorial v1.11"
git push origin --tags
```

- After a tag has been created, create a new release with that tag. 
- Set the title to "Cesium for Unreal VR Tutorial vX.X Latest".
- Remove "Latest" from the title of any previous releases.
- Add into the body any changes in this release, typically "Tutorials added in this release:"
```
Tutorials added in this release:

- "Tutorial Name"
```
