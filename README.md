# cesium-unreal-vr-tutorial
In this tutorial series, we will cover solutions for several common challenges  that come with building world-scale applications in VR using Cesium for Unreal.  The features we build will follow VR best practices to give players a better and more comfortable experience. We hope that this series can serve as a guide for thinking about VR design and user ergonomics in your own projects.

This tutorial will describe the UX challenge, our design thinking, and the Blueprint code for each feature. You can follow along from a blank project, or download the project files here to try them out yourself. Within each folder you will find a corresponding level which highlights a different feature. To see all features working together, open the main level located within the root content folder.

### :one: Tutorial 1 - Teleportation, Line Traces, and Height Correction

In the first tutorial we cover teleporting the user across long distances on Cesium World Terrain, and enforcing higher levels of detail on 3D Tiles from a distance. This tutorial also covers common issues in VR like moving below the surface and provides strategies to render line traces from the players hands.
